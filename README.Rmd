# localHierarchy

The `localHierarchy` R package provides functionality for fitting Bayesian hierarchical models in settings where both global and local estimation is required. The package provides R functions and Stan model components to support global modeling, in which all parameters in hierarchical models are estimated, and local modeling, where parameters are estimated for only one or a small number of populations, using fixed values from a global model fit.
