	abstract = {Several demographic and health indicators, including the total fertility rate (TFR) and modern contraceptive use rate (mCPR), evolve similarly over time, characterized by a transition between stable states. Existing approaches for estimation or projection of transitions in multiple populations have successfully used parametric functions to capture the relation between the rate of change of an indicator and its level. However, incorrect parametric forms may result in bias or incorrect coverage in long-term projections. We propose a new class of models to capture demographic transitions in multiple populations. Our proposal, the B-spline Transition Model (BTM), models the relationship between the rate of change of an indicator and its level using B-splines, allowing for data-adaptive estimation of transition functions. Bayesian hierarchical models are used to share information on the transition function between populations. We apply the BTM to estimate and project country-level TFR and mCPR and compare the results against those from extant parametric models. For TFR, BTM projections have generally lower error than the comparison model. For mCPR, while results are comparable between BTM and a parametric approach, the B-spline model generally improves out-of-sample predictions. The case studies suggest that the BTM may be considered for demographic applications.},

	abstract = {Estimation and monitoring of mortality, across multiple population-periods, is vital to improving national and global health outcomes. Reducing maternal mortality is a key part of the Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs), which commit countries and international agencies to monitor progress toward improvement of global maternal health outcomes. Country-specific estimates of maternal mortality are used for monitoring country progress. Civil registration vital statistics (CRVS) data provide valuable information on maternal mortality but are often subject to substantial reporting errors due to misclassification of maternal deaths or incompleteness of CRVS-reporting on deaths to women of reproductive age. Motivated by the challenge of estimating maternal mortality using error-prone CRVS data, this article introduces a Bayesian two-stage approach to obtain country-specific trends in maternal mortality ratios (MMRs), accounting for CRVS-related misclassification errors. In the first stage, we produce country-specific trends of CRVS-related data quality metrics, in terms sensitivity and specificity, through a Bayesian hierarchical misclassification model. In the second stage, we produce data-driven country trends in MMRs and proportion maternal deaths out of all-cause deaths, which are constructed using a Bayesian maternal mortality estimation model, accounting for CRVS-related data quality assessed in Stage 1. We present the approach to estimating maternal mortality and illustrate its use for several country case studies. This approach is used by the United National Maternal Mortality Interagency Group (UN-MMEIG) to produce maternal mortality estimates for global monitoring.},

We developed a Bayesian hierarchical bivariate random walk model to estimate sensitivity and specificity for multiple populations and years and used the model to estimate misclassification errors in the reporting of maternal mortality in CRVS systems. The proposed Bayesian misclassification (BMis) model captures differences in sensitivity and specificity across populations and over time, allows for extrapolations to periods with missing data, and includes an exact likelihood function for data provided in aggregated form. Validation exercises using maternal mortality data suggest that BMis is reasonably well calibrated and improves upon the CRVS-adjustment approach used until 2018 by the UN Maternal Mortality Inter-Agency Group (UN-MMEIG) to account for bias in CRVS data resulting from misclassification error. Since 2019, BMis is used by the UN-MMEIG to account for misclassification errors when estimating maternal mortality using CRVS data.},

	abstract = {Reducing the global burden of stillbirths is important to improving child and maternal health. Of interest is understanding patterns in the timing of stillbirths—that is, whether they occur before the onset of labour (antepartum) or during labour (intrapartum)—because stillbirths that occur intrapartum are largely preventable. However, data availability on the timing of stillbirths is highly variable across the world, with low- and middle-income countries generally having few reliable observations. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian penalized splines regression framework to estimate the proportion of stillbirths that are intrapartum for all countries worldwide. The model accounts for known relationships with neonatal mortality, pools information across geographic regions, incorporates different errors based on data attributes, and allows for data-driven temporal trends. A weighting procedure is proposed to account for unrepresentative subnational data. Results suggest that the intrapartum proportion is generally decreasing over time, but progress is slower in some regions, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {Background
Improving access to reproductive health services and commodities is central to development. Efforts to assess progress on this front have been largely focused on national estimates, but such analyses can mask local disparities. We assessed progress in reproductive health services subnationally in India.
Methods
We developed a statistical model to generate estimates and projections of levels and trends in family planning indicators for subpopulations. The model builds onto the UN Population Division's Family Planning Estimation Model and uses data from multiple rounds of the Demographic and Health Survey, the District Level Household \& Facility Survey, and the Annual Health Survey. We present annual estimates and projections of levels and trends in the prevalence of modern contraceptive use, and unmet need and demand for family planning for 29 states and union territories in India from 1990 to 2030. We also compared projections of demand satisfied with modern methods with the proposed goal of 75\%.
Findings
There is a large amount of heterogeneity in India, with a difference of up to 55·1 percentage points (95\% uncertainty interval 46·4–62·1) in modern contraceptive use in 2015 between subregions. States such as Andhra Pradesh, with 92·7\% (90·9–94·2) demand satisfied with modern methods, are performing well above the national average (71·8\%, 56·7–83·6), whereas Manipur, with 26·8\% (16·7–38·5) of demand satisfied, and Meghalaya, with 45·0\% (40·1–50·0), consistently lag behind the rest of the country. Manipur and Meghalaya require the highest percentage increase in modern contraceptive use to achieve 75\% demand satisfied with modern methods by 2030. In terms of absolute numbers, Uttar Pradesh requires the greatest increase, needing 9·2 million (5·5–12·6 million) additional users of modern contraception by 2030 to meet the target of 75\%.
Interpretation
The demand for family planning among the states and union territories in India is highly diverse. Greatest attention is needed in Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, and Meghalaya to meet UN targets. The analysis can be generalised to other countries as well as other subpopulations.

	abstract = {The annual assessment of Family Planning (FP) indicators, such as the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR), is a key component of monitoring and evaluating goals of global FP programs and initiatives. To that end, the Family Planning Estimation Model (FPEM) was developed with the aim of producing survey-informed estimates and projections of mCPR and other key FP indictors over time. With large-scale surveys being carried out on average every 3–5 years, data gaps since the most recent survey often exceed one year. As a result, survey-based estimates for the current year from FPEM are often based on projections that carry a larger uncertainty than data informed estimates. In order to bridge recent data gaps we consider the use of a measure, termed Estimated Modern Use (EMU), which has been derived from routinely collected family planning service statistics. However, EMU data come with known limitations, namely measurement errors which result in biases and additional variation with respect to survey-based estimates of mCPR. Here we present a data model for the incorporation of EMU data into FPEM, which accounts for these limitations. Based on known biases, we assume that only changes in EMU can inform FPEM estimates, while also taking inherent variation into account. The addition of this EMU data model to FPEM allows us to provide a secondary data source for informing and reducing uncertainty in current estimates of mCPR. We present model validations using a survey-only model as a baseline comparison and we illustrate the impact of including the EMU data model in FPEM. Results show that the inclusion of EMU data can change point-estimates of mCPR by up to 6.7 percentage points compared to using surveys only. Observed reductions in uncertainty were modest, with the width of uncertainty intervals being reduced by up to 2.7 percentage points.},

              that carries out the estimation of family planning indicators for a single population, for example, for a single country or smaller area. In this implementation of FPEM, all non-population-specific parameters are fixed at outcomes obtained in a prior global FPEM run. The development of this model was motivated by the demand for computational efficiency, without loss of model accuracy, when estimates and projections from FPEM were needed only for a single country. We present use cases to produce estimates for a single population of women by union status or all women based on package-provided data bases and user-specified data. We also explain how to aggregate estimates across multiple populations.

	abstract = {Background
Unintended pregnancy and abortion estimates document trends in sexual and reproductive health and autonomy. These estimates inform and motivate investment in global health programmes and policies. Variability in the availability and reliability of data poses challenges for measuring and monitoring trends in unintended pregnancy and abortion. We developed a new statistical model that jointly estimated unintended pregnancy and abortion that aimed to better inform efforts towards global equity in sexual and reproductive health and rights.
Methods
We developed a model that simultaneously estimated incidence of unintended pregnancy and abortion within a Bayesian framework. Data on pregnancy intentions and abortion were compiled from country-based surveys, official statistics, and published studies found through a literature search, and we obtained data on livebirths from the World Population Prospects. We analysed results by World Bank income groups, Sustainable Development Goal regional groupings, and the legal status of abortion.
Findings
In 2015–19, there were 121·0 million unintended pregnancies annually (80\% uncertainty interval [UI] 112·8–131·5), corresponding to a global rate of 64 unintended pregnancies (UI 60–70) per 1000 women aged 15–49 years. 61\% (58–63) of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion (totalling 73·3 million abortions annually [66·7–82·0]), corresponding to a global abortion rate of 39 abortions (36–44) per 1000 women aged 15–49 years. Using World Bank income groups, we found an inverse relationship between unintended pregnancy and income, whereas abortion rates varied non-monotonically across groups. In countries where abortion was restricted, the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion had increased compared with the proportion for 1990–94, and the unintended pregnancy rates were higher than in countries where abortion was broadly legal.
Interpretation
Between 1990–94 and 2015–19, the global unintended pregnancy rate has declined, whereas the proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion has increased. As a result, the global average abortion rate in 2015–19 was roughly equal to the estimates for 1990–94. Our findings suggest that people in high-income countries have better access to sexual and reproductive health care than those in low-income countries. Our findings indicate that individuals seek abortion even in settings where it is restricted. These findings emphasise the importance of ensuring access to the full spectrum of sexual and reproductive health services, including contraception and abortion care, and for additional investment towards equity in health-care services.

Focusing on the latter, we introduce a class of data models that can be used to combine data from multiple sources with various reporting issues. The proposed data model accounts for sampling errors and differences in observational uncertainty based on survey characteristics. In addition, the data model employs horseshoe priors to produce estimates that are robust to outlying observations. We refer to the data model class as the normal-with-optional-shrinkage (NOS) set up.

Estimates are obtained via a Bayesian statistical model that is fitted to country-specific data from surveys and service statistics data. The model has evolved over the last decade based on user inputs. This paper summarizes the main features of the statistical model used in FPET and introduces recent updates related to capturing contraceptive transitions, fitting to survey data that may be error prone, and the use of service statistics data. We use our experience with FPET to discuss lessons learned and open challenges related to the broader field of statistical modeling for monitoring of demographic and global health indicators to help further optimize the application of statistical modeling in practice.},

	abstract = {Background Expanding access to contraception and ensuring that need for family planning is satisfied are essential for achieving universal access to reproductive healthcare services, as called for in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Monitoring progress towards these outcomes is well established for women of reproductive age (15–49 years) who are married or in a union (MWRA). For those who are not, limited data and variability in data sources and indicator definitions make monitoring challenging. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide data and harmonised estimates that enable monitoring for all women of reproductive age (15–49 years) (WRA), including unmarried women (UWRA). We seek to quantify the gaps that remain in meeting family-planning needs among all WRA. Methods and findings In a systematic analysis, we compiled a comprehensive dataset of family-planning indicators among WRA from 1,247 nationally representative surveys. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model with country-specific time trends to estimate these indicators, with 95\% uncertainty intervals (UIs), for 185 countries. We produced estimates from 1990 to 2019 and projections from 2019 to 2030 of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning among MWRA, UWRA, and all WRA, taking into account the changing proportions that were married or in a union. The model accounted for differences in the prevalence of sexual activity among UWRA across countries. Among 1.9 billion WRA in 2019, 1.11 billion (95\% UI 1.07–1.16) have need for family planning; of those, 842 million (95\% UI 800–893) use modern contraception, and 270 million (95\% UI 246–301) have unmet need for modern methods. Globally, UWRA represented 15.7\% (95\% UI 13.4\%–19.4\%) of all modern contraceptive users and 16.0\% (95\% UI 12.9\%–22.1\%) of women with unmet need for modern methods in 2019. The proportion of the need for family planning satisfied by modern methods, Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicator 3.7.1, was 75.7\% (95\% UI 73.2\%–78.0\%) globally, yet less than half of the need for family planning was met in Middle and Western Africa. Projections to 2030 indicate an increase in the number of women with need for family planning to 1.19 billion (95\% UI 1.13–1.26) and in the number of women using modern contraception to 918 million (95\% UI 840–1,001). The main limitations of the study are as follows: (i) the uncertainty surrounding estimates for countries with little or no data is large; and (ii) although some adjustments were made, underreporting of contraceptive use and needs is likely, especially among UWRA. Conclusions In this study, we observed that large gaps remain in meeting family-planning needs. The projected increase in the number of women with need for family planning will create challenges to expand family-planning services fast enough to fulfil the growing need. Monitoring of family-planning indicators for all women, not just MWRA, is essential for accurately monitoring progress towards universal access to sexual and reproductive healthcare services—including family planning—by 2030 in the SDG era with its emphasis on ‘leaving no one behind.’},

Such forecasts would be an input to the production of probabilistic population projections for all countries, which is currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950-1995 and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 {\%} less than the current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in the sense that, for example, the 80 {\%} prediction intervals contained the truth about 80 {\%} of the time. We illustrate our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South Asia, a region with eight countries. Free, publicly available R software packages called bayesLife and bayesDem are available to implement the method.},

abstract = {<b>Background</b>: While probabilistic projection methods for projecting life expectancy exist, few account for covariates related to life expectancy. Generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics have a large, immediate negative impact on the life expectancy in a country, but this impact can be mitigated by widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus, projection methods for countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics could be improved by accounting for HIV prevalence, the future course of the epidemic, and ART coverage.

<b>Methods</b>: We extend the current Bayesian probabilistic life expectancy projection methods of Raftery et al. (2013) to account for HIV prevalence and adult ART coverage in countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics.

<b>Results</b>: We evaluate our method using out-of-sample validation. We ﬁnd that the proposed method performs better than the method that does not account for HIV prevalence or ART coverage for projections of life expectancy in countries with a generalized epidemic, while projections for countries without an epidemic remain essentially unchanged.

<b>Conclusions</b>: In general, our projections show rapid recovery to pre-epidemic life expectancy levels in the presence of widespread ART coverage. After the initial life expectancy recovery, we project a steady rise in life expectancy until the end of the century.

<b>Contribution</b>: We develop a simple Bayesian hierarchical model for long-term projections of life expectancy while accounting for HIV/AIDS prevalence and coverage of ART. The method produces well-calibrated projections for countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics up to 2100 while having limited data demands.},

abstract="Mortality can be analyzed according to two main frameworks: the cohort framework, which takes into account mortality risks as they unfold along the actual life cycle of a group of individuals born during the same period of time, and the period framework, which takes into account risks experienced by different cohorts during a single period of time. These frameworks provide two alternative ways for studying life expectancy. Analysis of time trends in life expectancy will differ depending on whether it is calculated by period or cohort. This chapter reviews the extent to which period and cohort life expectancies can be interpreted in terms of underlying health conditions for the corresponding periods and cohorts. While cohort life expectancy is an adequate indicator of a cohort's underlying health conditions, the connection remains elusive in the case of period life expectancy. Cohort influences and heterogeneity, in particular, appear to generate period life expectancy values that may not entirely reflect period conditions. This chapter also discusses a third and intermediate approach, the cross-sectional cohort approach, which offers some additional insights about the dynamics of mortality.",

@article{helleringer2015ebola,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An EVD outbreak may reduce life expectancy directly (due to high mortality among EVD cases) and indirectly (e.g., due to lower utilization of healthcare and subsequent increases in non-EVD mortality). In this paper, we investigated the direct effects of EVD on life expectancy in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea (LSLG thereafter). METHODS: We used data on EVD cases and deaths published in situation reports by the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as data on the age of EVD cases reported from patient datasets. We used data on non-EVD mortality from the most recent life tables published prior to the EVD outbreak. We then formulated three scenarios based on hypotheses about a) the extent of under-reporting of EVD cases and b) the EVD case fatality ratio. For each scenario, we re-estimated the number of EVD deaths in LSLG and we applied standard life table techniques to calculate life expectancy. RESULTS: In Liberia, possible reductions in life expectancy resulting from EVD deaths ranged from 1.63 year (low EVD scenario) to 5.56 years (high EVD scenario), whereas in Sierra Leone, possible life expectancy declines ranged from 1.38 to 5.10 years. In Guinea, the direct effects of EVD on life expectancy were more limited (<1.20 year). CONCLUSIONS: Our high EVD scenario suggests that, due to EVD deaths, life expectancy may have declined in Liberia and Sierra Leone to levels these two countries had not experienced since 2001-2003, i.e., approximately the end of their civil wars. The total effects of EVD on life expectancy may however be larger due to possible concomitant increases in non-EVD mortality during the outbreak.},
