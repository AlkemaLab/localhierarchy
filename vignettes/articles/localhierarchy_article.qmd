abstract: |
  Bayesian hierarchical models are widely used in global health estimation, where data availability may vary across national or subnational populations. Such models are typically fitted to a global database, e.g., to produce national-level estimates for all countries in the world or in some region. To facilitate analysis at a local level, models are often desirable that are informed by global models but can be fitted to just a subset of the data, such as data for one country. We refer to such models as local models: models that are derived from global hierarchical models but adapted such that they can be fitted to the data from one population alone.

  We present the `localhierarchy` R package, which provides functionality for fitting Bayesian hierarchical models in settings where both global and local estimation is required. The package provides R functions and Stan model components to support global modeling, in which all parameters in hierarchical models are estimated, and local modeling, in which parameters are estimated for only one or a small number of populations, using fixed values from a global model fit.

  This article presents a practical introduction to the package for the applied user and illustrates the package’s functionality through examples for national estimation.
